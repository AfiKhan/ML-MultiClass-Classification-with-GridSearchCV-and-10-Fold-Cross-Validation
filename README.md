# ML MultiClass Classification (One vs All) with GridSearchCV and 10 Fold Cross-Validation 
# Models: (Regularised Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, RandomForest)
# Explores how metrics like Avg- Accuracy, Avg-Precision, Avg-F1Score changes with parameter values of various classification models. Also explores which aggregation to use for these metrics: micro-avg, macro-avg and weighted-avg.
